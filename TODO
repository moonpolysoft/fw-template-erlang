can use error return value from parse transform for nicer fail
BUG: auto-generated vsn tags are not updated when version is bumped w/o make clean or file changes

add *.hrl to EXTRA_DIST in tests/
BUG:oldrecord_trans doesn't look at is_record guard calls
show all errors in oldrecord_trans before exiting
ensure cleanup of make-appfile-$$
include is symlink to src
(FW_)DIALYZERFLAGS += @FW_EUNIT_ERLCFLAGS@
when upgrade is downgrade, don't exit 1 to old handler in make-hooks
generate start/0
single pass to get registered, modules, and start: 3x faster!

BUG: dependency generation for erlang:
  * behaviours need to be compiled first
  * .erl files might depend upon .hrl files files
BUG: generate automatic dependency on erlang (or erlang-otp in fink?)

make directory structure look like otp, e.g., ebin, include, etc.?

--enable-coverage argument
        * seems like +debug_info slows things down so don't always want it

install a supervisor and gen_server as part of the installed files

-depends() for erlrc integration w/parse-transform default goodness
